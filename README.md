# neural-network
This is a silly javaScript library to create a neural network

I demonstrate the abilities of this code via a simple character recognition.
The code is in-line documented -- for further information I used as reference a paper by Michael Nielsen
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html
and watched the YouTube series Neural Networks - The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffmen

# please note -- this program has to be run in the Browser on a local server
also it might take quite a while to actually start -- read the documentation for further instructions
